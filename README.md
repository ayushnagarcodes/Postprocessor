# Postprocessor
 - It can read, write, and filter data from multiple CSV files.
 - It converts the password to a more secured format using SHA-256 hash function.
 - It uses Node.js modules such as the file system module, and the crypto module.
 - I learned how to store user information and reduce potential risks.
 - The project has 3 CSV files:
    - database.csv: add user data here
    - hash_database.csv: the password is encrypted and stored here
    - filtered_database.csv: it contains filtered data only (if user didn't enter "password" or "consent to mailing", then it will not be filtered)
 - Setup:-
   - Install node and npm
   - Install crypto module: npm install crypto
